# Install Theano requirements

Run `bash theano.sh -s` to install theano with full system requirements (e.g., `g++`), and leave out the `-s` flag to just setup the conda environment

Then `source activate theano` should have you all set up!

# More information

This is based on information availabe at the [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install_ubuntu.html) websites in particular
